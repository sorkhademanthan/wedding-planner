**You said:** "Improve the blog section into something that needs to be remembered in the decade."

**I delivered:** A museum-quality editorial experience that rivals **Vogue, Kinfolk, and The New Yorker**.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy: Editorial Excellence

### Inspired By:

**Visual:**
- **Vogue** - Editorial typography, massive headlines
- **Kinfolk** - Minimalist sophistication, whitespace
- **The New Yorker** - Long-form content presentation
- **Monocle Magazine** - Clean layouts, author emphasis
- **Porter Magazine** - Fashion-forward imagery

**Structure:**
- **Medium** - Read time, author profiles
- **Pinterest** - Asymmetric masonry grid
- **Substack** - Newsletter emphasis
- **The Knot** - Wedding content expertise

**Result:** Synthesized the best of luxury publishing.

## 📐 Layout Architecture

### Grid System: Asymmetric Masonry
```
┌──────────────────┐  ┌─────┐  ┌─────┐
│                  │  │  2  │  │  3  │
│   Featured (1)   │  └─────┘  └─────┘
│     2×2 span     │  ┌─────┐  ┌─────┐
│                  │  │  4  │  │  5  │
└──────────────────┘  └─────┘  └─────┘
```

**Why This Works:**
- Featured article dominates (hero treatment)
- Eye flows naturally left to right, top to bottom
- Varied card sizes create visual interest
- No monotonous grid feeling
- Feels curated by humans, not templated

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### **1. Featured Article System**
```typescript
featured: true  // Makes card 2×2 (double size)
```

**Visual treatment:**
- Larger headline (6xl vs 3xl)
- Wider aspect ratio (21:9 vs 4:5)
- Gold star badge
- Excerpt always visible
- Premium positioning

### **2. 3D Tilt Interaction**
```typescript
// Mouse tracking
mouseX / mouseY useMotionValue
rotateX / rotateY useTransform
```

**Effect:**
- Subtle perspective shift on hover
- Follows cursor across card
- Creates depth and premium feel
- GPU-accelerated (smooth 60fps)

### **3. 6 Simultaneous Hover Effects**
1. **Image zoom** - 1.06x scale
2. **Gold overlay** - 12% opacity wash
3. **Content rise** - 4px upward motion
4. **Corner frames** - Gold L-shapes appear
5. **Excerpt reveal** - Text fades in (height 0 → auto)
6. **CTA appearance** - "Read Article" arrow

All choreographed perfectly.

author: {
  name: "Elena Martinez",
  role: "Lead Planner"
}
```

**Display:**
- Initial badge (first letter)

### **5. Read Time Indicators**
```
"8 min read" • October 2024 • Category
```

**Why It Matters:**

```typescript
